The basic goal of Sketch Recognition is to allow non-artists to be able to draw visual content and then get their drawn image classified into a class of objects. Our goal in this project is to develop different Machine Learning and Deep Learning Models that help us to efficiently classify Sketches into their respective classes. We have used the Sketchy Database which provides us with a huge amount of supervised data for efficient training of various models. 
There are various models like the Google-Net Sketch model that have performed well in this domain. Our task is to try and build the best models we can using the techniques learnt in the course. We also use different image and Data pre-processing techniques to feed good trainable data into our created models. 


# Deployed at:
-Updated  serverless APP deployed only using netlify with tensorflowJS model

-old deployemnt (backend flask app on heroku and frontend on netlift). Backend got deleted due to herokus free to paid policy change.

# About the Project:
It is a course project under the Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning Course in Semester 4.

# Brief Description:
We have performed Sketch Recognition on 30 classes of objects using a CNN Network in tensorflow.
